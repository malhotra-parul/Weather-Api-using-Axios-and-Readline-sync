# Using Weather API with axios and readline-sync

This app takes input for the city name from the user to check for weather details.

Post that, **asynchronously**, menu options are displayed to the user:
## "y" :  if he would like to check weather for any other city.
## "n" : for exiting.

For the **asynchronous** part, **async await** has been used.
